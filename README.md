## Course Project

This project was meant to analyze the data from US Hospitals and generate a list of the best and worst hospitals for each 
state for a specific medical problem. (Heart Attacks, Heart Failure, Pneumonia)

Due to an issue with the shinyapps.io my app could not be deployed (too many links error). I still submitted a link where you can  
see that I attempted to but my app is undeployed. It is unfortunate but an issue that many of us faced and is beyond our control
I hope the grader can understand.
